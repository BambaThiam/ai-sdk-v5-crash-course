Our chat title generation dataset has some weaknesses.

It's high in quantity, and the quality is quite high.

But the coverage is low. We're not thinking about edge cases in our dataset. What happens if the user just says "yo"? What happens if ask a question in a foreign language? What if they ask a question where the topic is unclear or based on nonsense words?
