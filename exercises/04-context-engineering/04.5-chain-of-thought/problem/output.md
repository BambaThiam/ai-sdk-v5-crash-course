Okay, let's break down this TypeScript code. It uses a powerful pattern called the **Immediately Indexed Mapped Type (IIMT)** to create a discriminated union.

### `Prettify<T>` Utility Type

This is a utility type that simply "prettifies" a type.  It doesn't really change the *shape* of the type, but it can make the type more readable in some contexts. It does this by creating a new object type and then intersecting it with an empty object.  This forces TypeScript to evaluate the type more eagerly, which can sometimes make it easier to understand in the IDE or when debugging.

```typescript
type Prettify<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K];
} & {};
```

### `EventMap` Definition

This type defines a mapping of event names to their associated data. It's a key part of the discriminated union we're building.

```typescript
type EventMap = {
  login: {
    username: string;
    password: string;
  };
  logout: {};
  updateUsername: {
    newUsername: string;
  };
};
```

Here, we have three events: `login`, `logout`, and `updateUsername`. Each event has a specific shape, or payload, associated with it.  For instance, the `login` event has `username` and `password` properties.

### `EventAsDiscriminatedUnion` - The IIMT in Action

This is where the magic happens.  This type uses the IIMT pattern to construct a discriminated union from the `EventMap`. Let's break it down step by step:

```typescript
export type EventAsDiscriminatedUnion = {
  [K in keyof EventMap]: Prettify<
    {
      type: K;
    } & EventMap[K]
  >;
}[keyof EventMap];
```

1.  **Mapped Type:** `[K in keyof EventMap]: ...`

    This is the core of the IIMT. We're iterating over the keys of `EventMap` (which are the event names: `"login"`, `"logout"`, `"updateUsername"`). For each key `K`, we're creating a new type.

2.  **Creating the Discriminated Union Member:** `{ type: K; } & EventMap[K]`

    Inside the mapped type, for each key `K` (event name), we're constructing a new object type:
    *   `{ type: K; }`: This adds a *discriminant* property named `type`. The value of `type` is the event name itself (e.g., `"login"`, `"logout"`).  This is how we distinguish between different event types in the union.
    *   `& EventMap[K]`:  We then use the `&` operator (intersection) to combine this with the corresponding payload type from `EventMap`. For instance, when `K` is `"login"`, this part will be `{ username: string; password: string; }`.

    The result is a type that looks like this for each event:

    *   `login`: `{ type: "login"; username: string; password: string; }`
    *   `logout`: `{ type: "logout"; }`
    *   `updateUsername`: `{ type: "updateUsername"; newUsername: string; }`

3.  **Prettify for Readability:** `Prettify< ... >`

    We apply the `Prettify` utility type to each of the generated types.  This makes it more readable.

4.  **Immediate Indexing:** `[keyof EventMap]`

    Finally, we *immediately index* into the mapped type using `keyof EventMap`. `keyof EventMap` gives us the union of all the keys of `EventMap` (which is `"login" | "logout" | "updateUsername"`). By indexing into the mapped type with this union, we effectively extract all of the *values* of the mapped type. This turns the mapped type (which was an object with keys "login", "logout", and "updateUsername") into a union of the object types we created earlier.

    The final result, `EventAsDiscriminatedUnion`, is a discriminated union where each member has a `type` property that uniquely identifies the event type, and other properties that represent the event payload.
